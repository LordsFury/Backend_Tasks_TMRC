    "# What is Django?\n",
    "# Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables developers to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "# Key Features of Django are:\n",
    "# Comes with built-in tools such as authentication, an admin panel, forms, and ORM\n",
    "# MVT architecture\n",
    "# Secure\n",
    "# Rapid development\n",
    "# Scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Diff b/w Django and djangorestframework?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Django:\n",
    "# A full-stack web framework for building traditional web applications.\n",
    "# Focuses on rendering HTML templates, managing forms, handling HTTP requests/responses, and interacting with databases.\n",
    "# Best suited for websites that return HTML (like blogs, e-commerce sites, etc.).\n",
    "# Used for building server-rendered websites, Admin dashboards, and User authentication.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Django REST Framework (DRF):\n",
    "# An extension of Django designed to build RESTful APIs.\n",
    "# Allows you to build backend APIs that return data (usually in JSON) instead of HTML.\n",
    "# Makes it easy to expose Django models to other clients (like frontend apps built in React, Angular, or mobile apps).\n",
    "# Used for building APIs, creating JSON-based endpoints, and supporting CRUD operations over HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Django architecture?\n",
    "# Django follows the MVT architecture. It is similar to MVC (Model-View-Controller) but with slight naming differences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Model:\n",
    "# Handles the data and business logic.\n",
    "# Defines your database schema using Python classes.\n",
    "# Interacts with the database using Django’s ORM.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# View:\n",
    "# Controls the logic and handles requests/responses.\n",
    "# Fetches data from the model and sends it to the template.\n",
    "# Returns an HTTP response (HTML, JSON, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Template:\n",
    "# Manages the presentation layer (UI).\n",
    "# Displays data to the user.\n",
    "# Uses Django’s template language to embed dynamic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Django code level flow?\n",
    "# User Sends Request (Browser/Frontend):\n",
    "# User accesses a URL like:\n",
    "# http://localhost:8000/books/\n",
    "# URL Routing — urls.py:\n",
    "# The URL is matched with a route in the urls.py file.\n",
    "# View Logic — views.py:\n",
    "# When the URL matches, Django calls the corresponding view function or class.\n",
    "# Data Access — models.py:\n",
    "# The view fetches data from the database via the model.\n",
    "# Template Rendering — templates/books.html:\n",
    "# The view passes data (books) to the template for rendering HTML.\n",
    "# HTTP Response:\n",
    "# The template is rendered to an HTML page, and Django sends it back as an HTTP response to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Django request response cycle?\n",
    "# User Sends HTTP Request\n",
    "# A user opens a browser and accesses a URL, e.g.,\n",
    "# http://example.com/books/\n",
    "# The browser sends an HTTP request to the Django server.\n",
    "# WSGI/ASGI Gateway Receives Request\n",
    "# Django uses a WSGI/ASGI server (like Gunicorn, Daphne, or built-in dev server) to handle the incoming request.\n",
    "# Django Creates HttpRequest Object\n",
    "# Django creates an HttpRequest object from the raw request.\n",
    "# This object contains metadata like headers, method, user info, GET/POST data, etc.\n",
    "# Middleware Processing\n",
    "# The request passes through a middleware stack (defined in settings.py).\n",
    "# Middleware can  modify the request or response, handle authentication, sessions, security, etc. short-circuit and return a response directly\n",
    "# URL Dispatcher (Routing)\n",
    "# Django uses urls.py to match the request path to a view function.\n",
    "# View Function Execution\n",
    "# The matched view is called with the HttpRequest object.\n",
    "# It processes data, often interacts with the Model (database), and returns an HttpResponse.\n",
    "# Browser Request\n",
    "#      ↓\n",
    "# WSGI/ASGI Server\n",
    "#      ↓\n",
    "# Django Middleware (Request Phase)\n",
    "#      ↓\n",
    "# URL Resolver → Matched View\n",
    "#      ↓\n",
    "# View executes → Model (optional) → Template (optional)\n",
